In this assignment you will need to rely on the Ergast API once again.

Things you will need:
1. Form
Your form will accept a year and a season number. The only years allowed should be within a 20 year range. The season numbers allowed should be between 1-20. The form will take your data and send an AJAX request to your server using the information you typed into your form to build the API link.

2. Table
The data table will consist of each driver's information.
You will need to retrieve the driver's:
- position
- wins
- full name (their name should be a link to their Wikipedia page)
- nationality
- full name (their name should like)
- constructor name (their name should be a link to their Wikipedia page)

Things to consider:
1. Upon loading the page, you should not have any data showing in your table. In fact, you should not show a table at all if there's no data inside of it. Hide the table when the page loads and show a paragraph message instead saying 'Please search for a Season and Year to continue'
2. Once you submit the form, you should hide the paragraph message and show the table with all of the data inside of it.
3. Use only jQuery to perform your AJAX call.
4. Use only ES6 to write your arrow functions, callback functions and variables. Show your understanding of let vs const IF you need to.
